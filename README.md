# Atl√¢ntico Challenge

This is the project of a small [React](https://reactjs.org) application that is able to show in a friendly and responsive interface some important data based in the current pandemic crisis where data is fed by [COVID19 Public API](https://covid19api.com/).

With this application users can search the following data by country and date interval:

* Total Confirmed Cases
* Total Death Cases
* Total Recovered Cases

## Main resources and technologies involved

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling our source files.
* [react-day-picker](https://react-day-picker.js.org/) for showing an modern and elegant date picker.
* [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) for plotting the API data in a nice and clear graph. 
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for hosting our aplication.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization of our application.
